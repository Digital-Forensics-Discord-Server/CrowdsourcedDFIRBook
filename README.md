Check out the book on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/TheHitchhikersGuidetoDFIRExperiencesFromBeginnersandExperts) and Bookwire ([PDF](https://bookwire.com/book/USA/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-dfir-9798986335902-andrew-rathbun-85169559) and [ePub](https://www.bookwire.com/book/USA/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-dfir-9798986335933-andrew-rathbun-85353460)).

## What is this?

A DFIR book:

1. Being written on GitHub
2. Being edited on GitHub
3. Being self published through Leanpub
4. Being written by multiple co-authors collaboratively

## Why?

This is a proof of concept and a great first step for providing a different method of knowledge sharing within the DFIR space. 

## When will it be done?

Version 1.0 is live!

From the beginning, the writing and editing process has been fully transparent to the public! Check out the [Milestones](https://github.com/Digital-Forensics-Discord-Server/CrowdsourcedDFIRBook/milestones) to see where we're at. Stay tuned!
