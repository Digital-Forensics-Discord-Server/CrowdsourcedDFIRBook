## Overview

Packet capture files commonly called PCAP files are susceptible to modification. This modification can occur before or after the network traffic is captured by adding, deleting, or modifying the contents so that the file does not accurately reflect the original network traffic. These modifications can be intentional or accidental. While cryptographic hashes can help verify the integrity of PCAP files during the chain of custody, an examination of the contents of these files to see if the captured traffic flows are consistent with normal network traffic can help validate and ensure the integrity of these key evidence files.

## Introduction and Motivation

Network traffic can follow a predictable algorithm due to the individual conversations and protocols traversing the wire. This pattern can be difficult to detect due to the volume of traffic as the order of the individual conversations is not consistent. By examining the individual protocols, conversations, and subjects in a packet capture and rebuilding the original traffic inside of a packet capture file, it is possible to find indicators of tampering with the file. Certain traffic flows are expected to follow or coexist with other traffic flows. Some of the protocols that will be discussed are Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and Domain Name System (DNS) traffic. Other considerations related to MAC Address to IP address identity will also be discussed. Other possible indicators of compromise of packet capture (PCAP) files include the relationship between FTP control and FTP data transmissions, packet filler data, and SnapLen concerns. By building a baseline of known good traffic and with the use of algorithms, it is possible to provide metrics for finding the probability that a PCAP file has been modified. First, we will discuss these different types of protocols and their function on the network to show a better understanding of what normal traffic looks like. By knowing normal traffic, it will then be possible to spot anomalies.

## Background on PCAP Files and Approch to Detecting MODIFICATIONS

A packet capture file otherwise called a PCAP file is when raw network traffic is copied from the network and is put in a file. This can be done for a variety of reasons including network troubleshooting, analysis, and security. These files allow network administrators and analysts to review and analyze network traffic to identify issues, diagnose problems, and investigate security incidents. Traffic can be captured at network chokepoints, at the network parameter, or locations of particular interest like servers, firewalls, routers, or potentially compromised workstations. The primary purpose of this paper is to discuss the value of this raw data as it relates to an incident response perspective where threat actors have compromised a network and this evidence is gathered. This raw data can show how the threat actors were moving around the network and what type of data was exfiltrated. This network traffic could also be useful in insider threat investigations, compliance violations, and other types of cases as well. Verification of these files to ensure that there has been no tampering with the contents including adding, deleting, or editing the data can be beneficial to a successful outcome of the investigation.
Cryptographic hashes, or simply hashes, are a way to verify the integrity of data. The input is a string of data and the output is an extremely unique character string. Hashes can accept any data size as input, but the output is typically a fixed length. If the data hashed does not change or is otherwise the same even after multiple copies are created, then the hash will not change regardless of how many times it is copied. This means that hashes can be used to verify the integrity of a file. If a file is hashed and the value is recorded, the data can be run through the same hash algorithm at a later date. If the value remains unchanged then one can be certain that the data has not changed. This method only works if the date and time of the original hash can be verified with certainty [12].
One method of entangling the hash value with the date and time is to use a digital signature. A digital signature can be used to verify the authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of documents digital messages, or files. Digital signatures contain the identity of the creator of the digital signature, the public key of the signer, the digital signature itself which is created with the private key of the signer, and the timestamp the file was signed. This is an excellent way to verify the integrity of any file including PCAP files, but it requires additional setup to be used with a program that creates PCAP files. Wireshark is a commonly used tool to capture PCAP files and it does not natively support the ability to create a hash value or digital signature of the PCAP files it creates. It is possible to embed a digital signature with a PCAP file created by Wireshark using custom scripts, but this method requires a complex setup that is unlikely to have widespread use. Even if this method or a similar method was used at the time the PCAP file was captured, it would still be useful to verify the internal integrity of the captured network traffic for additional validation of the acquired evidence [2].

## MAC Address and IP Address Correlation

## Addressing Overview

There are two addresses for a node on a network, the physical address and the logical address. The Media or Medium Access Control (MAC) address is the physical address and the Internet Protocol (IP) address is the logical address. To facilitate normal communications with other nodes on a modern network, both addresses are required. However, when a node connects to a network it often will not have a logical address, it will only have a physical address. The physical address is burned into the Network Interface Card (NIC) so each NIC will have its own unique MAC address. To ensure the uniqueness of MAC addresses, each company that creates network interface cards is assigned one (or more) Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUIs). This OUI is the first half of the MAC address and the second half of the MAC address is unique to the device. Therefore, each company is responsible for keeping track of what numbers have been assigned to the second half of the NIC cards they have produced. The NIC manufacturer determines the MAC address that is burned into the NIC, while the network determines the IP address that will be used while that device is connected to the network. The reason that there are two addresses is that devices need to have some ability to communicate over the local network when connecting to the network to assign themselves a second address that will identify the device to a larger network. The larger network that uses IP addresses is arranged in a way to allow for efficient routing of packets, but smaller networks need to have the ability to connect and disconnect devices from the network so physical addresses are used to uniquely identify devices on that smaller network.
The burned-in physical address that is assigned by the manufacturer is normally used as the MAC address when communicating over the network. Due to privacy concerns, this is not always the case, but this will be discussed later. Upon connecting to a network, a device has two options for determining its logical address, the IP address. The device can use a preconfigured IP address or static IP addressing, but this is not a popular method. Static IP addresses do not allow for flexibility on dynamically changing networks. It is much more common to use dynamic IP addressing. Dynamic IP addresses allow devices to determine the IP address that they will use during that session which allows for improved functionality. There are two versions of Internet Protocol addresses. The first draft of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) was released in 1978 [13] and is still the primary Internet Protocol in use today. In 1998 Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) became a draft standard for the Internet Engineering Taskforce (IETF). IPv6 was developed to solve the problem of IP address exhaustion because it uses 128-bit addresses instead of 32-bit addresses [5].
When information is transmitted over the network it is transmitted in groups called datagrams. There are different layers to each datagram. The outermost layer is called a frame and it contains the physical addressing information. The next layer encapsulated inside of the frame is called a packet and it contains the logical addressing information. Encapsulated inside the packet is another layer called the segment and its addressing information uses port numbers that distinguish between different services running on the computers. Port numbers usually have a predefined destination number. The source port number is also predefined if related to a specific service but it is otherwise randomly generated [15]. Most datagrams will contain a total of six addresses including source and destination MAC addresses, source and destination IP addresses, and source and destination port numbers. One exception to this rule is Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) datagrams as they do not use port numbers because they are used for basic functions related to the state of the network. Some ICMP datagrams do have a unique field called an Identifier to support interoperability on private networks to ensure the datagrams are delivered to the correct host [14].

## Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

Now that we have laid the foundation for how addressing works on modern networks, we can start to discuss traffic over the network. On today’s modern networks, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is the primary way that IPv4 addresses are dynamically assigned and is still popular to assign IPv6 addresses. This process is performed when a device is connected to the network. DHCP is a four-step process; Discover, Offer, Request, and Acknowledge. The acronym of DORA is often used to describe this process. This conversation takes place between a client wishing to be assigned an IP address and a DHCP server. First, let’s discuss this process as it happens over an IPv4 network, but an IPv6 network has a very similar process [8].
The first step of this process is the Discover process. When a node wants to obtain an IP address it will send out a request to all nodes on the local segment to ask if there is a DHCP server that can assign IP addresses. When a datagram is transmitted to all devices it is known as a broadcast. The broadcast MAC address is FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF and the broadcast IP address that is used is 255.255.255.255. The source port number will be 68 and the destination port number will be 67. This request will also need a source and destination MAC address and IP address. The source MAC address is determined by the device and is usually the burned-in address, but the device does not have an IP address assigned to it yet so it uses all zeros for the source IP address. This message is sent as a request to DHCP servers listening on the local link telling the server that it wants to receive an IP address.
When a DHCP server hears this broadcast request it will respond to the node with an Offer message. The source MAC address and IP address will be its own MAC address and IP address. The source port will be 67 and the destination port will be 68. The destination MAC address will be the same as the received MAC address from the Discover message, and the destination IP address will be 255.255.255.255 because the client does not have an IP address yet. That is why this process is taking place! This message will contain an IP address that is being offered to the client. Typically, a DHCP server will keep a record of previously issued IP addresses to particular clients and assign a client an address that it has used in the past.
The node will respond with a Request message. The Request message will have the same addresses and port numbers as the Discover message. This message is from the client requesting the IP address that was offered to it in the previous message. 
The final message is the Acknowledgement or Ack message. This Acknowledgment message will have the same addresses and port numbers as the Offer message. It is the final step of the process and it will confirm that the client can start using the IP address sent in the Offer message. This is also the normal process for the client to determine the default gateway for the network as it has now received the DHCP server’s IP address two times and the DHCP server is normally the default gateway. The default gateway is also called the gateway of last resort as it is the location where a client sends a message if it does not know where else to send it to since there is no entry for that destination in the routing table.
The IPv6 protocol does not have broadcast messages and uses multicast messages instead. Rather than going to all nodes on the local link, a multicast message is only sent to nodes that are subscribed to listen for that particular type of multicast traffic. IPv6 also uses another way for nodes to obtain an IP address called stateless autoconfiguration. In this method, a node can assign itself an IP address, then it uses Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) to determine if that address is unique [6]. There are also combinations of the DHCP and stateless autoconfiguration methods, but this paper will not go into further detail on those methods. 
Why is this information important to detecting modified PCAP files? It is important because this is background traffic that is structured and will occur on all networks that dynamically assign IP addresses. The vast majority of modern networks use a form of dynamic IP address assignment, therefore this traffic should exist in a PCAP file. If there is traffic from a host that suddenly appears on a network without the DHCP or stateless autoconfiguration process occurring beforehand, that could be an indicator that traffic was added to the PCAP file. Conversely, if there is DHCP traffic between a client and server and then there is no further traffic from the client, that could be evidence that traffic was deleted from the PCAP file. 
Consider that this process shows how a MAC address is usually tied to a single IP address, but there are special circumstances where one device can use multiple IP addresses and MAC addresses. These instances include increased user privacy or situations where multiple routers are acting as the single default gateway. Modern devices especially cell phones will change their MAC address. This is done to ensure privacy for the user. Because the burned-in MAC address does not change, this can be used to uniquely identify a particular device on a network. Cell phones by their very nature are mobile and can connect to WiFi access points. WiFi access points can be configured to display the same Service Set Identifier (SSID) to the user, so the user does not change networks as they move around inside of a physical space like a shopping center. As the user moves, their phone will automatically disconnect and reconnect to different access points but remain on the same WiFi SSID. WiFi signals also record the strength of the devices that are connected to them. It would not be difficult to set up the access points to capture the MAC addresses, signal strength, and timestamps of the connected devices. That data could then be analyzed and the physical path through a shopping center that was taken by each individual shopper, including the time spent at each location, could be determined. Combine that data with Point-of-Sale transaction data and there would be significant privacy concerns that could be analyzed to record, predict, and categorize shopper habits. Under most circumstances, this method is not valid as phone manufacturers have taken steps to prevent this type of tracking. All Android devices running Android 10 and higher and all modern Apple devices have implemented randomization of the MAC address provided to access points in modern cell phones [3]. This is all done to protect user privacy by limiting the amount of data about an individual’s movement that can be obtained with WiFi analysis in public areas. While highly unlikely, this process could result in two different devices using the same MAC address and IP address combination at different points in time.
Another reason that the same IP address could be assigned to the same MAC address is router redundancy. By doing so a network administrator can achieve simplicity of network setup for workstations on a local link and redundancy in case of network failure in the form of a router going offline or a network link being broken [11]. Therefore, if these circumstances are nonexistent on the network and the traffic in question is coming from a client and not a router, there should be no reason for there to be mismatching MAC and IP addresses in a PCAP file. If there is a MAC and IP address mismatch, it could be evidence of alteration or editing of the PCAP file.

## Address Resolution Protocol / Neighbor Discovery Protocol

Now that a workstation has an IP address and it can communicate on the local network, it is now time for the workstation to send information to another node on the local network. An example of this would be when a workstation sends a print request to a printer on the local network. The workstation may have the IP address of the printer saved or would be able to obtain the IP address from the printer application, but it would also need the MAC address. 
Network devices commonly save a local cache of IP addresses to MAC address translations, but this cache has a time limit before those entries are discarded. If there is no entry in the local cache, a node will transmit a request over the local network segment asking for the MAC address of the node when it already knows the IP address of that node. On an IPv4 network, this process is known as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) while on IPv6 networks this process is known as Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP). 
On IPv4 this is a broadcast request so all nodes on the local segment will receive the packet. When a node sends an ARP request it is asking all the nodes for the MAC address of the device that has the IP address it wants to communicate with. Only the node that is assigned that IP address will respond to the request and let the node know what its MAC address is by sending an ARP reply message. Then the original node has all the information necessary to communicate with the target node [1].
IPv6 is slightly different as it does not use broadcast requests. Instead of sending a broadcast request, the node sends a multicast request. The use of multicast instead of broadcast is both more secure and reduces the overall traffic on the network if configured properly. The requesting node will send a multicast Neighbor Solicitation message that is addressed to the node that it wants to learn the MAC address. If the switch on the network is running the correct protocol, it will only forward that multicast request to the appropriate node. This will reduce the overall traffic on the network and direct the request to the correct node. However, if the switch is not running the updated protocol, it will still forward the request to all nodes on that local link. When the receiving node gets the Neighbor Solicitation message it will respond with a Neighbor Advertisement message addressed to the original node [7].
This process is important for detecting modified PCAP files because it is traffic that should exist on a local segment before nodes communicate with each other. If there is ARP or NDP traffic in a PCAP file but there is no other communication between those two nodes, it is possible that the communication between the nodes was deleted. However, if there is traffic between two nodes that starts without ARP or NDP traffic, it is possible that that traffic was inserted into the file. Make sure to remember the timeout of the local cache as ARP or NDP is not always needed before communication can take place, but it is important to consider. Finally, if there is ARP or NDP communication where the MAC addresses and IP addresses are not consistent with other communication between those two nodes, that is certainly a concern that could show traffic has been edited or inserted into the file. Overall, ARP and NDP are two additional background traffic protocols to consider when trying to determine if the data presented in a PCAP file are legitimate or if the data have been tampered with.

## Transmission Control Protocol

As was mentioned earlier, information is transmitted over a network in groups called datagrams. The information is encapsulated starting with the data link layer where the group is called a frame. Inside a frame is the network layer’s data called a packet. Inside a packet, the transport layer’s data is called a segment. Each one of these layers has an addressing scheme so the sender and receiver of the data can use it to get the information to the correct location on the network. Each layer has its own header to provide information to the receiver about where the data are coming from and where the data are going. The segment is the final header in this process that sits at what is known as the transport layer. There are two primary protocols at the transport layer. These are User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). When data is transmitted over the internet it usually has to be broken into smaller chunks because of the size limitations of the datagrams. Sometimes you do not need to keep track of the chunks of data, and this is where UDP is used [9].
Think about you and a friend who are pen pals and can only communicate by sending letters to each other. In this hypothetical situation, there is a weight restriction on the envelopes that you can send back and forth so that only one piece of paper can be sent in each envelope. If the message you are wanting to send is only going to be one page in length, then you do not need to send any other information when sending a letter. This is similar to how UDP works. Segments are sent over the network and are addressed to the recipient and there is no other information is required.
However, on modern networks, the data that is being sent will usually be bigger than one segment. This means that the data will need to be sent in multiple segments. Most of the time it is important to keep track of what data has been received to make sure all of the data are delivered correctly and to make sure they are reassembled in the correct order. Going back to the pen pal analogy, what if you wanted to send a book to your friend? Remember that you can only send one page per envelope, and you would not want to write on the pages of the book that you want to send. In this hypothetical situation, each page of the book would not be numbered, so you would have to put the order of the pages on each envelope. Also, you would probably need to send a letter before you sent any of the pages of the book letting your friend know what you were planning to send, how many pages to expect, the name of the book, etc. By numbering the envelopes, you would be doing it for two main reasons. One reason is to make sure that your friend received all of the letters in the event one of them was lost in the mail. If a letter did get lost your friend could simply send a letter back to you letting you know what pages you needed to resend so you would not have to resend the entire book. The other reason for numbering the envelopes is so that your friend could reassemble the letters in order so the book would make sense. It would also be a really good idea for your friend to send you a letter when all the letters arrived to let you know everything was received so you were not worried about having to resend anything and to let you know everything was correctly received. This requires additional work for both parties when addressing the envelopes and additional letters related to resending missing pages and information letting both parties know what to expect, and additional letters once everything was received or not.
This is a great way to think about how TCP works on modern networks. Before any data is sent in a TCP connection, there is a message sent to the intended recipient with a synchronize (SYN) flag which means it wants to send information. The recipient responds with a message with the acknowledge (ACK) flag and the SYN flag. Then the node starting the communication responds with an ACK flag. This process is called a three-way handshake and lets both parties get ready for the data that will be sent over the network. When sending the data, TCP provides a Sequence Number that provides the order of the segments being sent. Datagrams can be lost during transmission for many reasons. The two main reasons are noise and network congestion. Noise is when the signal experiences interference causing the message to be jumbled and unreadable. Network congestion is when there is so much traffic flowing over the network that routers have to discard some of the datagrams because there is just too much data. If any of the datagrams are lost during transmission, the communicating nodes can use the Sequence Number to let the other node know what data are missing that needs to be resent. Once all of the data have been transmitted or one of the nodes wants to end the conversation, the nodes end the connection with each other by sending additional messages that contain finish (FIN) flags. The terminating side will send a message that contains the FIN flag. The other side will respond with an ACK flag, and when it is finished sending will also send a FIN flag. The terminating side will respond with an ACK flag and the connection is terminated. The process for terminating a connection requires four flags instead of three to make sure that both sides can finish sending data.
When examining PCAP files this background information related to the TCP protocol can be very useful when determining the integrity of the data. If TCP connections start in the middle of the PCAP without the initial three-way handshake, then it is fairly obvious that data has been inserted into the PCAP file. The segments should also have the appropriate Sequence Numbers throughout the conversation with possible retransmit requests and responses inside of the file. If the ordering of the Sequence Numbers is not consistent then there can be concerns about the integrity of the data in the PCAP file.

## Domain Name System

The core language of computers is the binary system, or simply ones and zeros. This raw system is very difficult for humans to understand and we can understand it much easier when it is translated into a human language like English. One area where this translation occurs frequently is with the Domain Name System or DNS. DNS is used when a computer requests to visit a domain by calling the domain name. A domain name identifies a particular service on the internet including websites, email addresses, and more [4]. A Uniform Resource Locator or URL is used to identify a particular location or service on a website and contains at least two different levels of domains that are usually separated by periods or dots. Consider the URL www.google.com and its different domains. The “.com” portion is the highest-level domain or the top-level domain. The “google” portion is the second-level domain and identifies the particular website in the case of a URL.
When a user visits a website by typing www.google.com or any other website into their browser, the browser and the computer must translate that request to direct the user to the website and DNS is used to perform that translation to connect the client to the correct server. This translation is done for two reasons. The first is to provide the computer with the IP address of the website. As has been previously discussed, an IP address is required for communication over the modern internet. Websites use human memorable names in a language we understand to make it much easier for us to navigate the internet. The other reason DNS translates the name of the website into an IP address is that there are often multiple servers running the same website. These servers can be strategically placed within a geographic area to provide the highest quality of service to the users by directing the user to the closest server to their current location. This also allows for other nearby servers to provide service to clients when a server goes offline either due to server failure or network failure. All of this is done in the background when a user visits a website without the user being aware of DNS.
While DNS servers translate a domain into an IP address, client computers can store a local cache of DNS records locally on their hard drive. This prevents unnecessary queries to DNS servers, saves time, and saves network bandwidth. This is a good short-term solution, but the network is constantly changing so clients need updated information. Websites are being added and removed, servers are being added and removed, and connectivity issues can occur, so entries in all DNS caches including local caches are only good for a limited amount of time before they expire and are removed. If there is no entry in the DNS cache the client will reach out to a DNS server and request the IP address for the website it is trying to reach. The DNS server must provide a response to the client either in the form of an IP address or an error. Remember that there are different levels of domains like “.com” and “google” and this is critical to how the DNS server can respond to clients. There is a hierarchy of DNS servers that maintain and provide information on domains. Top-level domains like “.com” are the definitive source of information for all “.com” requests, but to share the load of responding to requests DNS servers share information with lower-tier servers in a hierarchical model. If a DNS server does not have information on a particular domain stored in its cache, it will reach out to a higher-level DNS server to request information [16]. One final thing to consider is that many web browsers will send out a DNS request for links on the current webpage. These requests are a form of preloading or precaching that speeds up the process if a user decides to visit that website.
This is important when investigating potentially modified PCAP files because this DNS traffic is usually going on in the background before a computer visits a website. If there is DNS traffic showing a request for information on a website but there is no traffic showing the content of the website, it could be that traffic was deleted from the PCAP file, but the preloading may be the cause of the DNS traffic. If there is DNS traffic showing a DNS translation but then the traffic shows communication with a different IP address than what was used for the DNS translation, the traffic might be edited. If there is no DNS traffic before the client reaches out to a website, then the traffic might be added if there is no entry stored in the computer’s local DNS cache. DNS is a complex system but it can provide clues that can show if a PCAP file was modified.

## Discussion of Detection Scripts

Now that several different methods of detecting modified PCAP files have been discussed, the problem is how to streamline and automate the process of finding these anomalies or otherwise verifying that these anomalies are not present in a PCAP file. To manually examine numerous PCAP files to determine if there were modifications would be an arduous task, but this process could be automated with the use of scripts in a programming language like Python. Other programming languages could be used as well, but Python is a commonly used language for tasks like this.
The script could look over a file and find the MAC address to IP address pairs, determine if there is DHCP, ARP, or NDP traffic associated with additional network traffic coming from a particular host, check if there are incomplete or non-sequential TCP traffic flows, and look for existing or missing DNS queries and resolutions that are not consistent with other network traffic to that IP address. Keep in mind that these scripts would help investigate the validity of a PCAP file, but if the script found something, further investigation would be needed to verify the nature of the modification and if such modification had even occurred. The scripts can provide metrics for finding the probability that a PCAP file has been modified, but additional research would need to be done to verify the existence of the modification or if the script found a false positive. Just like all investigations, the motto of “Trust but Verify” is very critical as there are many different explanations as to why network traffic may not be as expected.

## Conclustion and Future Work

Analyzing network traffic can be critical to many different types of computer investigations including network intrusions, intellectual property theft, fraud, insider threats, compliance violations, and more. When the network traffic is captured and a PCAP file is created by an entity that is not conducting the investigation, there can be concerns about the validity and integrity of the contents of that PCAP file. Chain of custody and digital signatures can help with some of those concerns, but it is not always possible to have a complete chain of custody for all files including PCAP files during an investigation. Digital signatures may not be associated with the captured network traffic. Even with a proper chain of custody in place, a method for verifying the integrity of the contents can be very useful to investigators.
By understanding what normal network traffic looks like, it is possible to find anomalies in that traffic when examining packet captures. Processes operating in the background to perform IP address verification (ARP and NDP), IP address assignment (DHCP), IP address discovery (NDP and DNS), and traffic flow handshakes (TCP) were discussed. Many other processes are operating in the background including the relationship between File Transfer Protocol (FTP) control and FTP data transmissions, packet filler data, and SnapLen concerns, which are other possible modification indicators. All of these processes are in the background and unseen by the user. By verifying that the background network traffic for processes exists as expected in a network packet capture file, it can not only determine if the evidence has been modified, but can also help verify the integrity of the evidence. Creating a solid case showing the true nature of the incident can lead to successful litigation outcomes, administer justice, and provide successful resolution for victims affected by these crimes.
